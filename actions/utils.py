    Check whether a concrete type is compatible with another type

    This function verifies if the concrete type `type_a` is acceptable when the expected type
    annotation is `type_b`.
    it can be thought of like 'Is type_a the same as type_b?'

    Args:
        type_a (Type[Any]): A concrete type (typically from a handlerâ€™s signature).
        type_b (Any): A type annotation representing the expected type. This may be a concrete type,
                      a union, or another form of type hint.

    Returns:
        bool: True if `type_a` is compatible with `type_b`, otherwise False.
